        <h2>The Feasibility and Governance of Cyclone Interventions</h2>

            <p>Climate change is worsening cyclone disaster risk. Current risk reduction responses focus on reducing
                vulnerability and exposure. Intervening in the cyclone hazard itself has the potential to prevent deaths
                and destruction, and reduce the costs of disaster recovery. In this paper, Aaron Tang and I co-led a
                review with Thao Linh Tran, Roslyn Prinsley and Mark Howden on the possible feasibility of these
                interventions and the governance implications therein. Potential interventions include cloud seeding,
                using pipes to inject cool
                water into cyclone hotspots, injecting particles into the upper atmosphere and atmospheric aerosol
                injections. Approaches have different logistical requirements, side effects and promise. Understanding
                the effectiveness and associated risks of different interventions will inform prudent cyclone risk
                management and research. Our review points to the promise of aerosol injection and high-altitude
                particle injection as first research directions. We also discuss potential governance risks and
                requirements of cyclone interventions. Cyclone interventions raise many issues, ranging from robust
                monitoring of ecological side effects, to geopolitics and politicisation. Current international climate
                governance is ill-suited for potential technologies on the horizon. Good decision-making is required to
                maximise benefits and reduce negative impacts.
