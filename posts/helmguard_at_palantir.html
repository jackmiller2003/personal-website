                Having worked on academic research in machine learning and AI security during my undergraduate studies
                and for some time afterwards, I've transitioned to industry, founding <a href="https://helmguard.ai"
                    target="_blank">HelmGuard AI</a> in fall 2024. This shift reflects my commitment to protecting
                critical institutions from the growing threat landscape accelerated by increasingly capable AI models by
                developing defensive applications in cybersecurity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recently presented HelmGuard at Palantir's developer conference, showcasing how we're bringing Agent
                Studio features into production through our AI Security Platform. Our solution addresses a critical
                challenge in enterprise security: the fragmentation of security-relevant data across wikis,
                spreadsheets, and other siloed systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                HelmGuard "terraforms" enterprise security data by ingesting and unifying scattered assets—policies,
                standards, architecture patterns, and compliance documentation — into a structured knowledge base that
                powers real-time, proactive security for both humans and AI. This foundation enables our AI Security
                Agents to operationalize security functions throughout the enterprise, continuously learning from actual
                usage to keep the data layer current and deliver precise, context-aware guidance.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my talk, I demonstrated a specific third-party risk management workflow where our platform
                automates the processing of security questionnaires. Similar deployments have reduced processing times
                by up to 90% while ensuring human involvement only where necessary. For enterprises, this capability
                translates to faster business operations without compromising security integrity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The power of our approach lies in how we structure data in the ontology, provide context-specific
                information through function-backed retrieval, and enable AI agents to take meaningful actions. While
                questionnaire automation represents just one application, these same building blocks can be adapted for
                various security workflows — from ticket management to documentation review — delivering immediate ROI
                while
                building toward a comprehensive security platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                A key element of our methodology is continuous evaluation and improvement. We've implemented an
                evaluation suite that allows even non-technical team members to review AI agent performance, identify
                edge cases, and refine the system iteratively. This approach ensures our solution remains relevant and
                effective as organizational needs evolve — especially crucial as open-source AI models become
                increasingly
                powerful, creating new attack vectors that traditional security tools aren't equipped to handle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our long-term vision is to evolve HelmGuard into a self-improving security "source of truth" that
                enables advanced use cases such as proactive threat modeling, AI-driven code remediation, and automated
                design reviews. As we expand in the financial services sector and beyond, we're demonstrating how
                AI-driven security solutions can drastically reduce human error and manual rework while maintaining
                compliance with complex regulatory requirements.
